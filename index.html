                    <h3>AN AUTHENTIC LEADER</h3>
                    <p>She is extraordinary. She knows who she is. She does not try to be anything other. She is an
                        authentic leader, which is critical. She has a set of strong values, and she understands
                        Germany’s history exceedingly well, in part because she comes from East Germany.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second__description">
                    <h3>ONE OF THE GREAT CHANCELLORS</h3>
                    <p>Considering the challenges she has faced, I would rank her as one of the great chancellors
                        because she dealt with, like some of her predecessors, a major critical development: the
                        breakdown of the established rules-based system in the wake of the U.S. election.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="third__description">
                    <h3>A LEADER RESPECTED</h3>
                    <p>She’s seen to be a problem-solver who sometimes puts other people’s best interests forward. And
                        that’s just so remarkably unlike most politicians, on both sides of the Atlantic, that she’s
                        stood out — to be serious, analytical, not always looking for the votes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fourth__description">
                    <h3>A CHILD OF THE EAST </h3>
                    <p>Her father was called “The Red Minister” because when everyone else was going west after the
                        division of Germany following World War II, he went east and took over a parish north of Berlin,
                        in the heartland of Brandenburg. It’s known for its correctness and its uprightness and the
                        values of German Protestantism: hard work, discipline, self-effacement, all those things
                        different from the German south.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fiveth__description">
                    <h3>FROM SCIENCE TO POLITICS</h3>
                    <p>She always was deeply interested in politics. She tells the story that she listened to West
                        German radio in secret at her parents’ home, that she always dreamt of visiting Westminster in
                        London, and so Parliament. Her first trip abroad led her to London.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sixth__description">
                    <h3>FREEDOM AND SUPPRESSION </h3>
                    <p>Her suspicion of the police state, her suspicion of authoritarian systems, her deep, deep belief
                        that liberalism and individualism are core to our whole existence — this all comes from her
                        35-year-old experience of being taught there and having to grow up in a system where she always
                        felt suppressed. She grew up in a pastoral household.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seventh__description">
                    <h3>THE WOMAN CALLED ‘MUTTI’ </h3>
                    <p>In the German vernacular, we have this expression that has become a verb: to merkeln, which is
                        “to wait for the strategic opportunity, or see how the chips lie, or how a landscape presents
                        itself, and then make a strategic move.” Because she’s a woman, they call her Mutti, which is
                        short for Mommy.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="commts">
                <h4>
                    STEFAN KORNELIUS:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    “The key to understanding Angela Merkel is that her biographical experiences have shaped her world
                    view. With the fall of the wall, her political life began.”
